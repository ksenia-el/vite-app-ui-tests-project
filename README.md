UI testing project for Vite App (http://34.141.58.52:8080)

Tests all UI elements on two pages: main page and login page. (Test for profile page are currently being developed)

The project was created as a part of an educational course by QALearning School.

▶️To run all tests at once use command "pytest tests" in Terminal. 
And to run only some tests (marked by either "smoke", "regressionion" or "flaky") use this format of the command: "pytest -m [mark] tests"
